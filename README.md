# Probability of Default â€“ Credit Risk Modelling

This project predicts the probability of default (PD) for SME borrowers using historical lending data, supporting smarter credit decision-making and improved risk segmentation for financial institutions.

---

## Problem Statement  
Predicting the probability of default is essential for banks and NBFCs to manage risk and comply with regulatory frameworks like Basel III. This project aims to model credit risk using real-world lending data and simulate a data-driven risk classification system.

## Tools & Techniques  
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Missing value handling, outlier removal, encoding  
- **Feature Engineering**: Created key risk indicators such as repayment history flags, credit behavior scores  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix, Precision-Recall

---

## Outcome  
- Generated predicted PD scores for 100K+ SME loan records  
- Segmented borrowers into **Low, Medium, and High risk tiers**  
- Visualized feature importance and probability distributions to support interpretability  
- Supported potential alignment with lending policies and portfolio-level decision-making

## Why It Matters  
This project simulates a practical credit scoring workflow using classification modeling. It mirrors how actual risk teams at financial institutions use borrower history to inform lending limits and risk buffers.
